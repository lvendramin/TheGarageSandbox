- This lib provides:
  1. beginSerial : Init the serial comunication (9600) 
  2. beginEthernet : Init the server
  3. bind : Bind a request method and URI with a function to handle the request (WOW! Like SpringMVC =P)
  4. restLoop : Put this function on your loop to read http requests and automaticaly call your binds! (WOW! Like SpringMVC =P)
