## restArdueasy
- A easy way to start a arduino+ethernet project. (still big =/)
- This lib provides:
  1. beginSerial : Init the serial comunication (9600) 
  2. beginEthernet : Init the server
  3. bind : Bind a request method and URI with a function to handle the request (WOW! Like SpringMVC =P)
  4. restLoop : Put this function on your loop to read http requests and automaticaly call your binds! (WOW! Like SpringMVC =P)
 
## LCD Temperature
- This small project was made to meet the requirements of a challenge of the CI&T 3D Printer
- Further info will be posted
